# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code

FastAPI is revolutionizing the way we build web APIs with Python. It's a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework that makes it incredibly easy and fun to create robust APIs. Here's why you should check it out:

- **High Performance**: Comparable to NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Rapid Development**: Increase your development speed by 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer Bugs**: Reduce human (developer) induced errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Excellent editor support. Autocompletion and type checks make coding a breeze.
- **Easy to Learn**: Spend less time reading documentation and more time building great stuff.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

From Microsoft to Netflix, FastAPI is being adopted by industry leaders and driving many automations and services. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, FastAPI has got you covered.
