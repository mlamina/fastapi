# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code, Ready for Production

Hey Hacker News community,

I'm thrilled to introduce FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn, minimizing code duplication and maximizing robustness and performance.

## Key Features

- **Fast**: Achieves very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Fast to code**: Increases development speed by about 200% to 300%, reducing human (developer) induced errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Offers great editor support, completion everywhere, and less time debugging.
- **Easy**: It's designed to be easy to use and learn, so you spend less time reading docs.
- **Robust**: Provides production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is not just another web framework. It's built with the aim of making API development faster, easier, and more efficient. Here are some reasons why you should consider using FastAPI for your next project:

- It's one of the fastest Python frameworks available.
- It significantly reduces development time and error rates.
- It's intuitive and easy to learn, even for developers new to web development.
- It encourages the use of standard Python type hints for validation, serialization, and deserialization.
- It automatically generates interactive API documentation.

## Seeking Feedback

I'm looking for feedback from the Hacker News community. Whether it's a feature request, a bug report, or general feedback on the framework, I'd love to hear from you. Your input will help make FastAPI even better.

## Get Started

Getting started with FastAPI is easy. You can install it with pip and start building your API in minutes. Check out the [documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) for more information and a step-by-step guide.

Thank you for checking out FastAPI. I'm looking forward to your feedback and seeing what you build with it!
