# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code, Ready for Production

Hey Hacker News community,

I'm thrilled to introduce FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to be easy to use and learn, yet powerful and ready for production.

## Why FastAPI?

- **Fast**: It's one of the fastest Python frameworks available, on par with NodeJS and Go.
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

## What's Unique?

FastAPI stands out with its high performance, ease of use, and comprehensive automatic interactive API documentation. It's built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts, ensuring a fast and efficient development process.

## Who's Using It?

FastAPI is trusted by developers at Microsoft, Uber, Netflix, and many more. It's being used in critical applications, from Windows and Office to Uber's Ludwig and Netflix's Dispatch.

## Get Started

Getting started with FastAPI is simple. All you need is Python 3.8+. The installation process is straightforward, and you can have your first API up and running in minutes.

Check out the documentation at [FastAPI's official website](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) to learn more and get started on your next project.

We're excited to see what you build with FastAPI!
