# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code, Ready for Production

FastAPI is revolutionizing the way we build APIs with Python. It's a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework that leverages standard Python type hints to bring you speed, ease of use, and fewer bugs. Here's why you should check it out:

- **High Performance**: Comparable to NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Rapid Development**: Increase your development speed by 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer Bugs**: Reduce human (developer) induced errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Excellent editor support and completion everywhere means less time debugging.
- **Easy to Learn**: Spend less time reading docs and more time building great stuff.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

FastAPI is being used by giants like Microsoft, Uber, and Netflix to power their services. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, FastAPI can help you do it better and faster.
