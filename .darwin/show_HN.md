# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Ready for Production

Hey HN community! I'm thrilled to introduce FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to be easy to use, intuitive, and to significantly reduce development time. Here's why you might find it interesting:

- **High Performance**: Comparable to NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Rapid Development**: Increase development speed by about 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer Bugs**: Reduce human (developer) induced errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support, completion everywhere, less time debugging.
- **Easy to Learn**: Spend less time reading docs.
- **Robust**: Production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

We've received fantastic feedback from users at Microsoft, Uber, and Netflix, who are leveraging FastAPI to build their services. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, FastAPI can help you get there faster and with fewer bugs.

Check out the interactive API docs and try it for yourself. We're excited to see what you build with FastAPI and look forward to your feedback and questions!
