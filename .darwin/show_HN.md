# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code

FastAPI is revolutionizing the way we build APIs with Python. It's a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework that leverages standard Python type hints to ensure high-speed development and fewer bugs. Here's why you should check it out:

- **High Performance**: Comparable to NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Rapid Development**: Increase development speed by 200% to 300%, reducing human errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Excellent editor support, completion everywhere, and less time debugging.
- **Easy to Learn**: Spend less time reading docs and more time building great applications.
- **Robust**: Production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

From Microsoft to Uber, Netflix, and beyond, FastAPI is being adopted by developers and companies worldwide for its ease of use, scalability, and performance. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, FastAPI has you covered.
