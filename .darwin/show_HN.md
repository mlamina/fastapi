# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code, Ready for Production

FastAPI is revolutionizing the way we build web APIs with Python. It's a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework that makes it quick and easy to build APIs. It leverages standard Python type hints to ensure high-speed development, fewer bugs, and intuitive design.

## Why FastAPI?

- **High Performance**: Comparable to NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Rapid Development**: Increase development speed by 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer Bugs**: Reduce human (developer) induced errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Excellent editor support and completion everywhere.
- **Easy to Learn**: Spend less time reading docs and more time building.
- **Robust**: Production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

## What's the Story?

Developed by Sebastián Ramírez, FastAPI has quickly gained popularity and is used by companies like Microsoft, Uber, and Netflix for their production services. It's designed to be easy to use and learn, yet powerful enough to build complex APIs.

## Key Features

- Automatic interactive API documentation.
- Deeply nested JSON models support.
- Dependency injection system.
- Security and authentication, including OAuth2 with JWT tokens.
