# Show HN: FastAPI - High Performance, Easy to Learn, Fast to Code, Ready for Production

Hey HN community! I'm thrilled to introduce FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to be easy to use and learn, yet powerful and ready for production right out of the box.

## Why FastAPI?

- **Fast**: Achieves very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%, reducing human (developer) induced errors by about 40%.
- **Intuitive**: Offers great editor support, completion everywhere, reducing the time spent debugging.
- **Easy to learn**: Designed to be easy to use and learn, allowing you to spend less time reading docs.
- **Robust**: Provides production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

## What's in it for you?

By using FastAPI, you're not just getting a fast and efficient framework for building APIs; you're also joining a community of developers who are building some of the most innovative applications out there. From Microsoft to Uber to Netflix, FastAPI is being used to power a wide range of services and applications.

Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, FastAPI provides you with the tools you need to make your project a success. So, if you're looking for a framework that can keep up with your ideas, give FastAPI a try.
